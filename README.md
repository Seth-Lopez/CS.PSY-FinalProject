How to use our app:
Open the Google Drive and Run the APK file with your VR Headset connected. We tested using an Oculus Quest 2

Use the side triggers on the VR controllers to grab objects and make a throwing motion, releasing the trigger at the correct time to throw the object. Walk around using the left joystick and use the right joystick to look around.

Known bugs/issues:
Currently, we have a collision box set on the dad and the score should increment upon the ball overlapping the collision box.
However, the score does not increment when that occurs currently.
We could not get animations to work on the dad object with the time given.
